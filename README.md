# 4 Axis PCB Stencil Printer w/ Rotational Axis

This is a GitHub mirror/fork of the 4 Axis PCB Stencil Printer
with Rotational Axis by Philipp of [Dengler Mechatronik GmbH](https://dengler-mechatronik.de/).

You can find the source material on:
* [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5690704)
* [Initial announcement](https://dengler-mechatronik.de/?p=560)
* [Digital build log](https://dengler-mechatronik.de/?p=790)

I chose to build this project because of its large working field,
and focus on what really matters - accurate stencil alignment.

My role here is little more than digital historian and backfiller
of missing data and instructions. I may contribute something on my
own, but for now, three cheers to Philipp!
